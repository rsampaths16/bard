# Bard - A storyteller for your repositories

Many project repositories are filled with numerous files and directories. As the repository grows it becomes increasingly complex. Any developer who is new to the repository and wants to sneak a peek at the project has to go through the code and the documentation. Wouldn't it be awesome if every file and directory had some information about its contents attached to it, which could make a developers life easier?

Bard is a utility aimed to maintain content/meta information of files and folders in repositories. It is meant to be an information control system. Information maintained by it can be used to easily navigate and understand a repository. A user should be able to add, modify, delete and migrate information about files and directories in their repository.
